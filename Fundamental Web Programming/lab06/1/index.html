        <h1>Programming Language</h1>
        <p>A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs. Programming languages are described
            in terms of their syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), usually defined by a formal language. Languages usually
            provide features such as a type system, variables, and mechanisms for error handling.</p>
